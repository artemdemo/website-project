# Website Project

- Static website generator
  - Allow content to be written in markdown
  - Allow custom js content
- Static content
  - Blog

  - Different sizes for images
- Custom dynamic content
  - Contact form

## ToDo

- Error stack links to js files in the `dist`. It will be cooler if I could link to `ts` files instead.
  - Most likely I will need to proveid source maps for that to happen.
  - How to reproduce - throw an error in the builder.
