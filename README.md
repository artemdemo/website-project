# Website Project

- Static website generator
  - Allow content to be written in markdown
  - Allow custom js content
- Static content
  - Blog
  - Tags
  - Different sizes for images
- Custom dynamic content
  - Contact form
  - Games or any other dynamic content
- Export static site to a separate folder, that has separate git repository
- Markdown
  - https://mdxjs.com/docs/getting-started/

## ToDo

- Why is it "blog" maybe it should be "site" and "blog" will be only one feature?
- Error stack links to js files in the `dist`. It will be cooler if I could link to `ts` files instead.
  - Most likely I will need to proveid source maps for that to happen.
  - How to reproduce - throw an error in the builder.
